Main goal of this project is to view a given youtube video video using diffrent IP addresses. This bot uses selenium web driver with Tor client. The bot will only try to view the video from the begining and it will not simulate a real human user. Therefore, it needs to be improved to mimic authentic human behaviour. For instance, skiping to multiple timelines, watching the video to some random time and close etc.
